# VGAE_ED-for-Latent-Representaion-in-ST
Exploring Onthology based profiling for supporting raw mRNA counts information in Spatial Transcriptomics (ST) using a deep learning approach based on Variation Graph Autoencoders.

We present an alternative way of profiling cell or spots in Single Cell technologies using a Onthology reference, this information can be used alongside mRNA count information as support information or as base count information
